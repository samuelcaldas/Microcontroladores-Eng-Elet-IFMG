# Microcontroladores - Eng. Elet. IFMG

This repository contains the files and codes related to the Microcontrollers course of the Electrical Engineering program at IFMG.

## Objectives

The objective of this course is to introduce the concepts and applications of microcontrollers, as well as to develop programming and design skills with these devices.

## Content

The content of the course covers the following topics:

- Introduction to microcontrollers: architecture, peripherals, programming languages and development tools.
- Programming in C language: basic structure, variables, operators, control structures, functions, vectors and matrices.
- Embedded systems design with microcontrollers: sensors, actuators, displays, keyboards and communication with other devices.

## Prerequisites

To follow this course, you will need:

- A computer with an Arduino IDE installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- An Arduino board and a USB cable to connect it to your computer. You can use any model of Arduino, but we recommend the Arduino Uno for beginners.
- A breadboard and some electronic components such as LEDs, resistors, potentiometers, buttons and wires. You can find a list of the components used in each practical lesson in the respective folders.

## Usage

To run the codes in this repository, you will need to:

- Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
- Open the .ino file of the lesson you want to run from the File menu or by double-clicking on it.
- Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the Upload button or pressing Ctrl+U.
- Observe the behavior of your Arduino board and the serial monitor (if used) according to the instructions of each lesson.
